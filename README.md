# Memory-Game

Welcome to my NBA Memory Game. Starting at the Home Screen you can pick between trying to match the East or West teams, and there is an instructions button for anyone new that doesnâ€™t know how to game works.

After you pick a side you are brought to their respective screen. On the top you can see your current number of attempts, and the high score will set itself after you finish the game. After this if you press play again the high score will set itself to the lowest number of attempts you get, 
since technically the lower number is better in this game. After you press a card you cannot click it again, and once you match a pair you cannot press that same pair again.
